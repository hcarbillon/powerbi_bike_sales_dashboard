## Overview
Bike sales dashboard built in Power BI, showcasing sales performance for December 2021. It contains the total orders per model and country, profits earned, and the demographic breakdown in relation to sales orders. This dashboard is designed to provide companies with a strategic outlook when making decisions.

## Goals & Insights
- Cleaned and prepared the raw dataset using the built-in Power Query
- Removed irrelevant columns, such as Day, Month, Year, Product_Category, Sub_Category, as few of these contained uniform values
- Split some of the columns to remove unnecessary details and separate relevant values for analysis
- Identifed the total orders by country and state using the drill-down functionality
- Higlighted the average age of customers and the total number of orders using card visualization
- Provided a line chart to display the units sold throughout the month of December, leading up to the holiday
- A stacked bar chart was used to present total profit and units sold for each model

## Data Source
The raw Excel dataset used in this project is taken from Kaggle. It contains 89 bike transactions and includes 19 columns, such as Sales_Order#, Date, Age, Country, Model, and more.
